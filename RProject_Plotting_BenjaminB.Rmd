# Exploratory Plotting

In this assignment, we are going to be making exploratory and explanatory plots using the `msleep` dataset

```{r}
glimpse(msleep)
```


1. First, you're told that you should consider the `brainwt` and `bodywt` on the log10 scale. Create new variables using `mutate` that are the `log10()` of those two variables.

```{r}

```

2. Let's start with a one variable plot, of a discrete (categorical) variable. I want to know the distribution of the variable `vore`, the diet type of the animals. 

First, create a summary table using our dplyr tools: count how many animals are in each diet type. 

```{r}

```

Next, create a bar plot of that variable. What does this tell you? What's the most common diet type? The least common? 

These give you the same information, but in different ways! Which do you prefer? 


```{r}

```


3. Now, a one variable plot, of a continous variable. This `sleep_total` variable seems interesting. Let's see first how the overall distribution of the variable looks: use `geom_density()` to plot the emperical density of the variable. (hint: using the `fill = "some_color"` argument makes the density plots a little easier to read)

```{r}

```

4. A natural next question, using the two variables above is whether the distribution of the total sleep of the animals varies by diet. Use a graph to show this in some way. 

```{r}

```

A little processing.... We want to remove the entries that have NA for the diet types, and we want to use order, but we want to remove orders that have less than 5 members to them. This isn't always a good idea, but in this case we're looking at broad picture and distribution between the groups.  (Remember species, `genus`, family, `order`, class, phylum, kingdom, domain?)

```{r}
# look at the data, consider that we want to remove the NA and the small orders. 
msleep %>% count(vore)
msleep %>% count(order)

# this graph is the scratch work I'd suggest doing to decide where to draw the cutoff 
# msleep %>% count(order) %>% ggplot(aes(x = n)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

Use `add_count`, the mutate version of `count`, to get an additional column that contains the count of the order of that row. 
```{r}
msleep_data_ordervore <- msleep  %>%
    filter(!is.na(vore))         %>%  # Only cases with data for diet
    add_count(order)             %>%  # Find counts for each order, use ?add_count  for more info
    filter(n >= 5)                

```


5. Two discrete/categorical variables: Let's look back at our diet bar graph. Using our new subsetted data, add in a second discrete variable, `order`, using `fill` to see if each of the diets have a different distribution of the orders. 

```{r}

```

Try again, but make it a "dodge" bar chart like we learned in the notes, and make another  "fill"ed one like we discussed.

What would be the benefits of the fill/percentage graph? What are the drawbacks? 

```{r}

```

6. Two continuous variables: Let's finally look at those log10 weights! Still using our new msleep_data_ordervore, make a scatter plot with `log10_brainwt` on the x axis and `log10_bodywt` on the y axis. 

```{r}


```


7. Add in categorical variables: make the shape encode the `order` of the animals, and the color encode their diet (`vore`). What can you now see about the herbivores? 

```{r}



```

8. Give this plot a title, and rename the axes appropriately. 

```{r}


```
